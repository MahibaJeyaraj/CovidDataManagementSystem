                        <h2>1) Common cold</h2>
                        <p>The common cold is a viral infection in your upper respiratory tract. Viruses cannot be treated with antibiotics. In most cases, viruses like the cold just need to run their course. You can treat the symptoms of the infection, but you can’t actually treat the infection itself.</p>
                        <p>The most effective and common home remedies for a cold include:

                        <h6>Gargling with salt water:</h6> A salt water gargle can help coat your throat and ease irritation.
                        <h6>Drinking plenty of fluids:</h6> Staying well hydrated helps you replace fluids you’ve lost while also helping relieve congestion.
                        <h6>Using vapor rub:</h6> Vapor rub topical ointments help open your airways and ease congestion.
                        <h6>Getting lots of rest:</h6> Getting plenty of rest helps your body save energy to let the virus run its course.
                        <h6>Zinc lozenges:</h6> Zinc lozenges may reduce how long cold symptoms last if they’re taken at the very start of your symptoms.
                        <h6>Echinacea:</h6> According to research, echinacea may be effective at reducing the duration of a cold in some cases.</p>
                        <br>

                        <h2>2) Sore throat</h2>
                        <p>A sore throat is the feeling of pain and dryness in the throat. Most sore throats are caused by infections or by environmental factors like dry air.
                        Sore throats are often uncomfortable, giving a feeling of a ‘scratchy throat’ or ‘swollen throat’ that make you want to cough to clear the throat irritation. However, it is usually harmless and goes away on its own.

                        </p>
                        <p>Home remedies for a sore throat:
                            <h6>
                            Drink water</h6>                                                                                   It is important to remain hydrated when you are under the weather by drinking plenty of water. Staying hydrated can help ease congestion, thin mucus secretions and keep the throat moist.

                            <h6>Salt water</h6>                                                                                Did you know that gargling warm salt water may also help to reduce some of the swelling? Add half a teaspoon of salt to a full glass (240ml) and gargle up to 3 times a day.

                            <h6>Warm liquids</h6>
                            Drink warm liquids that are soothing to the throat, such as hot tea with honey, hot soups, warm water with lemon or herbal teas.

                            <h6>Apple cider vinegar</h6>                                                                       Mix 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar with 240ml of water. The acid in the vinegar can kill bacteria in the throat and soothe a sore throat.

                            <h6>Peppermint essential oil</h6>                                                                Make some peppermint tea, add some peppermint oil to a diffuser or rub some on the chest to soothe a sore throat and ease a dry cough.

                            <h6>Cold treats</h6>                                                                            Eating frozen foods such as popsicles, sorbets or ice cream can help ease the pain of a sore throat. Choose non-dairy items as dairy products can produce more mucous and further irritate the throat.
                     </p> 
                     <h2>3) Stomach ache</h2>
                     <p>A stomach ache refers to cramps or a dull pain in the tummy (abdomen) that is usually temporary and is often not serious. </p>  
                     <p><h6>Ginger</h6>
                        Many individuals swear by eating ginger biscuits, taking ginger supplements or sipping ginger tea when they feel queasy.

                        The digestive benefit of ginger is no myth – a natural anti-inflammatory, ginger has been shown by many studies to be effective in relieving certain types of stomach ills.

                        <h6>Chamomile tea</h6>
                        A cup of chamomile tea may also help to relax tense stomach muscles and soothe cramps.

                        <h6>Mint</h6>
                        Mint has been used as a traditional treatment for indigestion, gas and diarrhoea in countries such as Iran, Pakistan and India. Traditionally, it is boiled with cardamom to make tea. The menthol in mint may help with preventing vomiting and diarrhoea, reducing muscle spasms in the intestines and relieving pain.

                        <h6>BRAT diet</h6>
                        The BRAT diet may help people with diarrhoea. It stands for bananas, rice, applesauce and toast. These foods can help bind foods together to make stools firmer. They are also rich in nutrients such as potassium and magnesium and can replace those lost through diarrhoea and vomiting.

                        <h6>Cinnamon</h6>
                        Cinnamon contains several antioxidants that may help ease digestion and reduce the risk of irritation and damage to the digestive tract. Adding 1 teaspoon of good-quality cinnamon powder to your meals or mixing it with boiling water to make a tea may help relieve indigestion. You may do this 2 – 3 times daily.

                        <h6>Figs</h6>
                        Figs contain substances that can act as laxatives to ease constipation and indigestion. Eating whole figs a few times a day or brewing 1 or 2 teaspoons of fig leaves to make tea may help with constipation symptoms. </p>  

                        <h2>4) Headache</h2>
                        <p>Headache can refer to pain in the head that feels like throbbing or squeezing sensations and may be constant or intermittent. The pain may be felt in one part of the face or skull or may be generalised involving the whole head.
                        Headaches may arise spontaneously or may be associated with activity or exercise. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting, especially with migraine headaches. Common types of headaches are tension, migraine and cluster headaches.</p>
                        <p><h6>Rest and hydration</h6>
Getting enough rest and staying hydrated is one of the first steps to treating a headache. Most patients with migraine headaches get much relief after resting in a dark room and falling asleep.

<h6>Sooth pain with a cold compress</h6>
Wrap an ice pack in a cloth and apply it to the neck or head area. This helps decrease inflammation, slows nerve conduction, and constricts blood vessels, all of which contribute to relieving the headache.

<h6>Massage</h6>
A gentle massage may also help to relieve some of the tension in your temples or neck. Maintain pressure for 7 – 15 seconds, then repeat.

<h6>Essential oils</h6>
If you have a migraine, inhaling lavender essential oil for 15 minutes may help to ease the pain. Apply it to the temples or breathe directly over the bottle.

<h6>Magnesium</h6>
Magnesium deficiency has been found to be common in people who get frequent migraine headaches. Taking oral magnesium citrate supplements may help in reducing both the frequency and severity of migraine headaches.

<h6>Coffee or tea</h6>
Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee or tea, may provide headache relief. Caffeine improves mood, increases alertness and constricts blood vessels. These actions help relieve headache symptoms.</p>
